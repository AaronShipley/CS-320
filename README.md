Software Testing and Automation


1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring one's code, program and software is secure and functional should be a top priority of a developer. In order to ensure software is functional to mee requirements, one should utilize proper testing techniques and automation testing during the devlopment lifecycle. By ensuring requirements are properly tested to ensure code functionality meets expectations, one is also securing their code as well in some aspects. One can implement secure software techniques and resources within their code, program or software, implementing testing techniques to test the security implemented as well.


2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are incorporated into software via functional and non-functional requirements. The requirements are first documented from the client. The documentation is then implemented into the software. The requirements are based off the needs of the user from the software. Without requirements implementation, the software will not be able to grasp the true needs of the client from the software. 

3.  How do I approach designing software?

My apporach to designing software is relatively simple. I approach with a mindset that iterates small portions of the software in what the Agile methodology calls sprints. The sprints typically focus on a specific requirement of the software. Through the development of the code for the requirement, i will then wear multiple hats to avoid bias. After an iteration is written, testing will be implemented properly before proceeding to the next sprint. Through this iteration process, failures and error detection will be often and more manageable.
